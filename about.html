      I'm a 3rd Year Computer Science Graduate with a passion for game development 
      and a diverse skill set acquired through my university modules. My academic 
      journey has covered crucial aspects of system development, including data 
      management, optimization and security.
    </p><p>
      However, where my greatest enthusiasm truly lies is in crafting visually 
      captivating experiences, whether they're in the form of games, websites 
      or visually related AI projects. This passion led me to focus my final 
      dissertation on AI art generation using diffusion models.
    </p><p>
      Since graduating, I've resumed my journey of continuous learning 
      in the field of game development. I've actively pursued a variety of game 
      projects to gain experience across the entire game development spectrum. 
      Additionally, I've invested time in enhancing my skills through Unity courses, 
      allowing me to broaden my knowledge and expertise.
    </p><p>
      My goal is to bring innovation and creativity to the world of gaming and 
      I'm always excited to take on new challenges and projects that allow me to 
      showcase my skills and contribute to the gaming industry.
    </p><p>
      Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my projects I've 
      worked on and the skills I've honed along the way.
