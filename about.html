        <p>
          I'm a game programmer who began my journey with a Computer Science degree, where I built a solid foundation in 
          system development, including data management, optimization, graphics and security. Since then, I've been 
          working through a Level 7 game programming apprenticeship at Sumo Digital.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past year, I've had the incredible opportunity to work on real-world game projects, significantly 
          expanding my knowledge beyond what I initially learned in university or my own research. Through hands-on experience with libraries, 
          frameworks and both internal and proprietary game engines, I've collaborated closely with artists, designers and 
          producers, tackling complex systems along the way. This experience has deepened my passion for crafting immersive 
          and engaging experiences, while also allowing me to contribute by creating tools for team members, developing 
          in-depth graphics (including writing shaders and setting up rendering pipelines) and making meaningful contributions 
          to large codebases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects I've worked on and the skills I've developed along the way.
