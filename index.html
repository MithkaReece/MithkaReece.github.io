                        <p>Initially a group project, set out to make a basic Rogue-Like Game and learn game development skills. 
                            Due to many of the members having other commitments most of them did not have for any contributions. 
                            One member draw a few pieces of concept art and another coded a brief skeleton of a stats system. 
                            These contributions were very minor and with no intention of any other members to continue this project 
                            and the majority of the work up to this stage coming from myself, 
                            I decided to turn this into my own solo project. This allows me to further refine my game development 
                            skills and getting the game closer to a finish state will allow me to utilising finishing technologies
                             such as particles effects, visual effects, optimisations and compatibity of devices that can run the game.</p>
                        <h2>Current Development (Summer 2023)</h2>
                        <p>My goal at the moment is to complete the most basic of systems such as combat, procedure level generation and 
                            basic progression system to round off the game play loop. I then want to finish off the game in that state but 
                            still allowing any new content to be added when needed.</p>

                        <h2>Previous Development (Summer 2020)</h2>
                        <p>Development was over a week and due to covid I could spend all my time doing it. 
                            This was my first experience with anything multiplayer or any communication between servers. 
                            I decided to user sockets are they maintain connections with the player allowing faster and 
                            2 way communications. I wanted to simulate a real multiplayer game and avoid potentially cheating 
                            by simulating the logic rules on the server as well as making the client only allow valid moves. 
                            The clients only request to make a move and the server has to approve the move to send out the 
                            updated state of the game. I had little experience with visuals in the browser so I essentially 
                            manually set the locations and angles of the cards present as well as working out the angles that 
                            each other player would be sitting round the centre cards. If it was to remake this, I would 
                            definitely look for some library that would achieve this for me as well as allowing animations 
                            for card playing and effects. One feature which I did not manage to finish as it cause several 
                            bugs, was the uno button which announces when you will have one card. This was mostly due to my 
                            code not being very organised making it very hard to track origins of bugs however it was an good 
                            lesson in why organising code bases are very important even for small projects like this.</p>

                        <h2>Development (September 2020)</h2>
                        <p>I wanted to attempt a small recreation of the Age of Empires DS game as I wanted to try and make a game 
                            with turn based moves, resource collections and none-orthographical 2D perspective. The progress I made 
                            on this project was adding terrain generation, resource collection, building menus and interactions, 
                            training and moving friendly units and lastly the changing of turns which allowed the other player to move. 
                            The player movement had to work out each square that the unit could move to account for how far the unit can 
                            move as well as how the terrain will affect this distant. I then highlighted these squares and allowed the 
                            player to click on them to move there. What was left to add was the combat system itself which would not be 
                            too hard to implement as they are just interactions between 2 opposing unit stats. The more complex system 
                            would be the buffs as enemies get buffs depending on the type of terrain square they are in.</p>

                        <h2>Development (Jan-Mar 2020)</h2>
                        <p>This was the project for year 13 Computer Science coursework, after being inspired by many technologies such as AI and Computer 
                            Graphics and wanted to do both. I wanted to see if I could apply my Maths and Further Maths knowledge to achieve 3D graphics. 
                            First, I tried raycasting like seen in the original Doom game however I wanted the ability to look up and down. I then used plane 
                            and vector maths to find intersections of point on a viewing plane I defined. I then came up with my own clipping algorithm which 
                            would essentially project a polygon onto a plane and then work out new 2D vertices within the clipping plane. This did come with 
                            some issues and helped me understand why we only project triangles in 3D graphics instead of polygons. I further used raycasting 
                            to determine the depth of an object to remove unseen objects as well as order the drawing of projected polygons. This is as far 
                            as I got with the 3D graphics as I then moved onto wall collisions to stop player moving through wall. I also made a main menu used 
                            to pause the game as well as display a win/lose screen and option to do another level. For the maze I also used a 2D maze generation 
                            algorithm which I had to map to 3D wall objects however instead of each wall being single objects, I merge consecutive wall into 
                            single wall objects to reduce the number of objects. In addition, because I also wanted to do something with AI, I added a monster 
                            which can traverse the maze and attempted to make him learn how to find the player using Q-Learning. Now looking back on it, this is 
                            not really an good use of Q-Learning AI and also I never setup an environment to train the AI itself. This meant the AI was only 
                            learning during your run and would then reset every run and essentially always be stuck on the random exploring phase. However, I did 
                            still really enjoy looking into how Q-Learning actually works with reinforcement learning and how it is incorporated with neural 
                            networks for large state actions spaces.</p>

                        <p>This was the first project of my own that really got me into computer science. I had been messing around with graphics using Javascript and the p5 
                            library making art using recursively algorithms such as fractals. I wanted to make a simple game that I could easily use this graphics library 
                            for the visuals and create everything else myself. I ended up making my own mini matrix library for some of the calculations as well as collision 
                            detection and physics. I made use of noise to make the asteroids intersting shapes but that did make collision detection more difficult to implement. 
                            In the end the game is mostly finished and very playable, bar the aliens which were only half implemented and disabled to be able to play. 
                            I also added my own effects for such as fire animations for when the ship thrusts, particles effects that come off asteroids when the collide and 
                            split and finally pieces of your ship when you get hit.</p>

                        <h2>Development (March 2019)</h2>
                        <p>I first recreated the game snaked by trying to efficiently implement the snake as well as the collisions. 
                            This was achieved by having a queue of points to represents the snake and each move would added a head to 
                            the front of the snake and remove the end of the tail. When the snake eats food it would just skip one step 
                            of removing the tail to increase the length of the snake. Then the collision was only checked against the 
                            square the next head was going to be, whether it was out of bounds or part of the snake. Then instead of 
                            manually playing the game I wanted to experiment with some algorithm for the snake. For example, a basic but 
                            effective algorithm is to just span the rows of the grid leaving one space, essentially moving across every row 
                            and then back up to the top. This is a slow algorithm however will always give the best results. Secondly, a 
                            made an algorithm that would path find to the food around its tail in the shortest steps. This made the snake 
                            very quick to the food and increasing length however could easily lead to trapping itself.</p>
