            <h3>Previous Development - Summer 2020</h3>
            <p class="description">Development was over a week and due to covid I could spend all my time doing it. 
              This was my first experience with anything multiplayer or any communication between servers. 
              I decided to user sockets are they maintain connections with the player allowing faster and 
              2 way communications. I wanted to simulate a real multiplayer game and avoid potentially cheating 
              by simulating the logic rules on the server as well as making the client only allow valid moves. 
              The clients only request to make a move and the server has to approve the move to send out the 
              updated state of the game. I had little experience with visuals in the browser so I essentially 
              manually set the locations and angles of the cards present as well as working out the angles that 
              each other player would be sitting round the centre cards. If it was to remake this, I would 
              definitely look for some library that would achieve this for me as well as allowing animations 
              for card playing and effects. One feature which I did not manage to finish as it cause several 
              bugs, was the uno button which announces when you will have one card. This was mostly due to my 
              code not being very organised making it very hard to track origins of bugs however it was an good 
              lesson in why organising code bases are very important even for small projects like this.</p>
