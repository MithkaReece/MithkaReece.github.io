            <h3>Previous Development - Summer 2020</h3>
            <p class="description">Spanning over the course of a week, my dedicated focus on development was 
              made possible by the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. This project marked my first foray 
              into the realm of multiplayer functionality and communication between servers. To achieve this, 
              I opted for sockets, as they facilitate persistent connections with players, enabling quicker and 
              bidirectional communication.
              </p><p>
              The overarching aim was to replicate the dynamics of a genuine multiplayer game while preempting 
              potential cheating. This was achieved by simulating logic rules on the server and enforcing validity 
              checks for moves on the client side. The communication flow was structured such that clients requested 
              moves, which required server approval before distributing the updated game state.
              </p><p>
              My experience with web-based visuals was limited, which prompted me to manually position cards and 
              ascertain the angles for their orientations. Additionally, I calculated the angles at which each player 
              would be situated around the central cards. Reflecting on this, if I were to embark on a similar project 
              again, I would explore libraries that could simplify card layout and introduce animations for card 
              interactions and effects.
              </p><p>
              Regrettably, a specific feature, the "Uno" button, remained incomplete due to its association with 
              various bugs. The challenges I faced in debugging were compounded by a less organized codebase, 
              underscoring the significance of code organization, even for smaller projects like this.</p>
            <h3>Current Development - Summer 2023</h3>
            <p class="description">In the time that has passed, I've returned to this project with a newfound 
              perspective and knowledge gained over the past three years. One significant overhaul involved 
              completely refactoring the backend. Drawing from the lessons learned during this period in which I 
              graduated from my degree in Computer Science, I've 
              modularized and organized the backend into a more structured state. This approach notably facilitated 
              the resolution of issues, like the previously problematic Uno button feature and the successful 
              implementation of the call-out functionality.
              </p><p>
              In addition to these improvements, I've begun work on expanding the project's capabilities. One 
              notable addition is the incorporation of a lobby system. This enhancement allows for the existence of 
              multiple lobbies, catering to various groups of people, as opposed to the previous single, fixed lobby setup.
