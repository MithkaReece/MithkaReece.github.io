            <h3>Development - September 2020</h3>
            <p class="description">I wanted to attempt a small recreation of the Age of Empires DS game as I wanted to try and make a game 
              with turn based moves, resource collections and none-orthographical 2D perspective. The progress I made 
              on this project was adding terrain generation, resource collection, building menus and interactions, 
              training and moving friendly units and lastly the changing of turns which allowed the other player to move. 
              The player movement had to work out each square that the unit could move to account for how far the unit can 
              move as well as how the terrain will affect this distant. I then highlighted these squares and allowed the 
              player to click on them to move there. What was left to add was the combat system itself which would not be 
              too hard to implement as they are just interactions between 2 opposing unit stats. The more complex system 
              would be the buffs as enemies get buffs depending on the type of terrain square they are in.</p>
