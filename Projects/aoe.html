            <h3>Development - September 2020</h3>
            <p>I embarked on a modest reimagining of the Age of Empires DS game, 
              driven by my desire to explore the creation of a turn-based game with elements like resource 
              gathering and a non-orthographic 2D perspective. My progress in this endeavor involved several key achievements.
              </p><p>
              I successfully integrated terrain generation, enabling the creation of diverse landscapes. 
              Resource collection mechanics were implemented, allowing players to gather essential 
              resources. Building menus and interactions were developed, providing players with the means 
              to construct structures and engage with them.
              </p><p>
              Additionally, I tackled the intricacies of training and maneuvering friendly units. 
              One noteworthy aspect was the turn-changing mechanism, enabling alternating player movements. 
              To facilitate player movement, an algorithm was devised to calculate feasible unit paths based 
              on movement capabilities and terrain influences. These valid paths were highlighted and could 
              be selected by players for unit movement.
              </p><p>
              One significant task left to implement was the combat system itself. Although not 
              overly complex, it involved interactions between opposing unit statistics. A more intricate 
              system lay in the realm of buffs, where enemies were granted advantages contingent on the terrain type they occupied.
              </p><p>
              This project allowed me to grasp the foundations of turn-based gameplay, resource management 
              and unit interactions, while also offering insights into the complexities of terrain-based 
              effects on gameplay mechanics.</p>

          <h1 style="font-size: 2rem;">NOTE</h1>
          <p>
            To begin with, it's important to mention that due to the constraints posed 
            by limited sprites, there's a divergence between the visual representation 
            and the actual in-game elements. Although the sprite may depict two villagers, 
            players actually commence with just one villager, a unit capable of constructing 
            structures. Additionally, each player starts with a militia unit, a foundational 
            combat unit (although the combat functionality hasn't been implemented yet). 
            Furthermore, buildings that lack their own dedicated sprites are temporarily 
            denoted by the blue townhall sprite, serving as a stand-in for the time being.

            The demo showcases the gameplay mechanics of Age of Empires: Age of Kings, 
            a turn-based strategy game. In this game, resources such as food and gold are integral and 
            each unit is permitted specific actions per turn. When units are selected, their movement 
            capabilities are visually highlighted. Once a unit is moved to a location, a user interface 
            (UI) offers a range of potential actions possible for that square. Upon pressing "Enter," 
            the turn shifts to the next player, allowing them to take their actions. It's worth noting 
            that players can only manipulate their own units and interact with their own buildings.
            </p><p>
            The terrain is procedurally generated, incorporating diverse terrain square types. These 
            squares impact the distance units can travel across them. Additionally, gold and food 
            deposits are strategically placed, which villagers can utilize for construction. Certain 
            buildings, highlighted in blue, can serve as foundations for the construction of other 
            buildings. The game features several building types, including mills, mines, townhalls, 
            castles, stables, and barracks. Mills and mines yield food or gold every turn, while 
            townhalls can train villagers in one turn using up these resources. The intention was 
            to expand this functionality to stables and barracks for training combat units.
            </p><p>
            The sidebar UI incorporates various options, such as settings, main menu, map view and 
            an "unmoved unit finder" feature. A notable enhancement in this version compared to the 
            DS version is the integration of mouse control, which offers a more efficient gameplay 
            experience. However, traditional controls are retained, allowing players to traverse 
            squares using WASD and select them using the space key.
