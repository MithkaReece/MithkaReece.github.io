            <h3>Development - January-March 2020</h3>
            <p class="description">This was the project for year 13 Computer Science coursework, after being inspired by many technologies such as AI and Computer 
              Graphics and wanted to do both. I wanted to see if I could apply my Maths and Further Maths knowledge to achieve 3D graphics. 
              First, I tried raycasting like seen in the original Doom game however I wanted the ability to look up and down. I then used plane 
              and vector maths to find intersections of point on a viewing plane I defined. I then came up with my own clipping algorithm which 
              would essentially project a polygon onto a plane and then work out new 2D vertices within the clipping plane. This did come with 
              some issues and helped me understand why we only project triangles in 3D graphics instead of polygons. I further used raycasting 
              to determine the depth of an object to remove unseen objects as well as order the drawing of projected polygons. This is as far 
              as I got with the 3D graphics as I then moved onto wall collisions to stop player moving through wall. I also made a main menu used 
              to pause the game as well as display a win/lose screen and option to do another level. For the maze I also used a 2D maze generation 
              algorithm which I had to map to 3D wall objects however instead of each wall being single objects, I merge consecutive wall into 
              single wall objects to reduce the number of objects. In addition, because I also wanted to do something with AI, I added a monster 
              which can traverse the maze and attempted to make him learn how to find the player using Q-Learning. Now looking back on it, this is 
              not really an good use of Q-Learning AI and also I never setup an environment to train the AI itself. This meant the AI was only 
              learning during your run and would then reset every run and essentially always be stuck on the random exploring phase. However, I did 
              still really enjoy looking into how Q-Learning actually works with reinforcement learning and how it is incorporated with neural 
              networks for large state actions spaces.</p>
