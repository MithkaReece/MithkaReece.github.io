            <h3>Development - January-March 2020</h3>
            <p class="description">This project emerged as a result of my fascination with technologies such 
              as AI and computer graphics, which inspired me to combine both realms. The endeavor was undertaken 
              as part of my year 13 Computer Science coursework. My goal was to test the application of my knowledge 
              in Mathematics and Further Mathematics to achieve 3D graphics.
              </p><p>
              My initial approach involved experimenting with raycasting, akin to the technique employed in 
              the original Doom game. However, I sought the capability to look both up and down, which led me 
              to utilize plane and vector mathematics to determine point intersections on a defined viewing plane. 
              To address the issue of creating a 3D environment while maintaining realistic perspectives, I devised 
              my own clipping algorithm. This approach projected polygons onto a plane and then calculated new 2D 
              vertices within the clipping plane. This endeavor was enlightening, highlighting the reasons why 
              triangles are typically used instead of more complex polygons in 3D graphics.
              </p><p>
              Subsequently, I employed raycasting for depth determination, aiding in the removal of hidden 
              objects and ordering the drawing of projected polygons. This marked the extent of my progress with 
              3D graphics, after which I transitioned to implementing wall collision mechanics to prevent players 
              from moving through walls.
              </p><p>
              Beyond graphics, I developed a main menu for pausing the game and displaying win/lose screens, 
              alongside the option to proceed to another level. In the realm of maze creation, I utilized a 2D 
              maze generation algorithm, transforming it into 3D wall objects. To optimize this process, I consolidated 
              consecutive walls into single objects, reducing object count.
              </p><p>
              An additional dimension was introduced with the inclusion of an AI-controlled monster that 
              navigates the maze. My goal was to make the monster learn to find the player using Q-Learning. 
              In retrospect, the implementation fell short, as the AI's learning was restricted to individual runs, 
              preventing it from acquiring a substantial learning curve. Additionally, my exploration of Q-Learning 
              revealed its interaction with reinforcement learning and neural networks for addressing complex 
              state-action spaces.
              </p><p>
              This project not only allowed me to explore the intersection of AI and computer graphics but 
              also highlighted the iterative nature of learning and refinement in the development process.</p>
