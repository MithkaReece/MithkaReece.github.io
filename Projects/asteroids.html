            <h3>Development - Christmas 2019</h3>
            <p class="description">This was the first project of my own that really got me into computer science. I had been messing around with graphics using Javascript and the p5 
              library making art using recursively algorithms such as fractals. I wanted to make a simple game that I could easily use this graphics library 
              for the visuals and create everything else myself. I ended up making my own mini matrix library for some of the calculations as well as collision 
              detection and physics. I made use of noise to make the asteroids intersting shapes but that did make collision detection more difficult to implement. 
              In the end the game is mostly finished and very playable, bar the aliens which were only half implemented and disabled to be able to play. 
              I also added my own effects for such as fire animations for when the ship thrusts, particles effects that come off asteroids when the collide and 
              split and finally pieces of your ship when you get hit.</p>
