            <h3>Development - Christmas 2019</h3>
            <p class="description">This was the first project of my own that really got me into computer science. I had been messing around with graphics using Javascript and the p5 
              library making art using recursively algorithms such as fractals. I wanted to make a simple game that I could easily use this graphics library 
              for the visuals and create everything else myself. I ended up making my own mini matrix library for some of the calculations as well as collision 
              detection and physics. I made use of noise to make the asteroids intersting shapes but that did make collision detection more difficult to implement. 
              In the end the game is mostly finished and very playable, bar the aliens which were only half implemented and disabled to be able to play. 
              I also added my own effects for such as fire animations for when the ship thrusts, particles effects that come off asteroids when the collide and 
              split and finally pieces of your ship when you get hit.</p>

          <p class="description">Rocket that can turn, thrust with a fire trangle effect and shoot bullets at asteroids.
            Upon collision, asteroids split into smaller fragments with a shattering particle effect. 
            Lives are limited, but the score persists until they're depleted. 
            The ship is wrapped by the screen, whilst asteroids confine their existence close to the screen. 
            Randomly generated asteroids enter with varying velocities from the screen's edges. 
            Their shape is created by offsetting points of a circle polygon using random noise.</p>
