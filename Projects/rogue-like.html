            <h3>Previous Development - Summer 2022</h3>
            <p>Initially conceived as a group project, our aim was to create a basic Rogue-Like 
              Game and collectively acquire game development skills. However, due to various commitments, most 
              members were unable to contribute significantly. A few members provided minimal input, such as a 
              handful of concept art pieces and a rudimentary framework for a stats system.
              </p><p>
              Given the limited contributions and lack of ongoing commitment from other team members, coupled with 
              the fact that the majority of the progress up to that point was driven by my efforts, I made the 
              decision to transform this endeavor into a solo project. This choice affords me the opportunity to 
              further refine my game development abilities. </p>
            <h3>Current Development - Summer 2023</h3>
            <p>My current objective is to finalize the fundamental systems within the game, 
              including combat mechanics, procedurally generated levels and a basic progression system. This will 
              complete the core gameplay loop. Once these components are in place, I intend to consider the game in 
              a finished state, yet retaining the flexibility to introduce new content as required.
              </p><p>
              Subsequently, refining the game to a polished state will allow me to incorporate additional elements 
              such as particle effects, visual enhancements, optimization strategies and ensuring the game's compatibility 
              across a range of devices capable of running it.</p>

            <p>This video showcases the primary focus of the project, the combat system. 
              The mechanics employ state machines to govern both player and enemy actions along with their 
              corresponding animations. Communication between the player and enemy is achieved through events, influencing their states.
              </p><p>
              The combat system draws inspiration from games like Sekiro and Souls-Like titles. Players can 
              employ actions such as rolling to evade attacks, blocking to mitigate damage, and executing 
              well-timed parries to stun enemies. A distinctive feature is the poise meter, depicted as a 
              purple circle that fills up. When fully charged, it results in stunning the opponent and inflicting 
              substantial damage. This effect, however, diminishes shortly after, making it possible only after a 
              sequence of consecutive attacks. The circular indicators below the player and enemy portraits illustrate their remaining health.
              </p><p>
              Notably, the weapon sprites are dynamically positioned and animated through transformations. 
              This dynamic framework permits the seamless swapping of weapon sprites, thereby enabling 
              multiple weapons to share specific attack animations, with the animations being character-dependent. 
              Both the player and enemy share the same stick character base for their animations, differentiating 
              only by the addition of clothing overlays for the player. This smart approach allows animations to be shared between players and enemies.
              </p><p>
              Additionally, I explored the conversion of 3D animations into 2D pixel art animations. This 
              technique simplifies character manipulation and creation, eliminating the need to redraw 
              animations. Dead Cells uses a similar method to streamline the animation process.
