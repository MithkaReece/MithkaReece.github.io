            <h3>Previous Development - Summer 2022</h3>
            <p class="description">Initially a group project, set out to make a basic Rogue-Like Game and learn game development skills. 
              Due to many of the members having other commitments most of them did not have for any contributions. 
              One member draw a few pieces of concept art and another coded a brief skeleton of a stats system. 
              These contributions were very minor and with no intention of any other members to continue this project 
              and the majority of the work up to this stage coming from myself, 
              I decided to turn this into my own solo project. This allows me to further refine my game development 
              skills and getting the game closer to a finish state will allow me to utilising finishing technologies
               such as particles effects, visual effects, optimisations and compatibity of devices that can run the game.</p>
            <h3>Current Development - Summer 2023</h3>
            <p class="description">My goal at the moment is to complete the most basic of systems such as combat, procedure level generation and 
              basic progression system to round off the game play loop. I then want to finish off the game in that state but 
              still allowing any new content to be added when needed.</p>

          <p class="description">This video shows off the combat system which was the main focus of this project.
             The system uses state machines to handle actions of both player and enemy as well as their animations. 
            Events are used to communicate interactions between the player and enemy which affect their states. 
            The combat system is inspired by Sekiro and Souls-Like combat, where player's can roll to dodge attacks, 
            block to mitigate damage, parry to stunned the enemy if well timed. Additionally, player's and enemies 
            have poise meters shown by the purple circle filling up and if attacked at full they are stunned and take 
            a very large amount of damage, the meter does decrease shortly after therefore can only be triggered after many
            consecutive attacks. The ring below the player and enemy also show the amount of health left. Additionally, the 
            weapon sprites are dynamically placed and animated via transformations, allowing any weapon sprite to be swapped 
            out with a different one. This allows many weapons to share certain attack animations as the animation is only 
            dependent on the character. The player and enemy use the same stick character base for their animations, the only 
            different is the player has some clothes drawn over the top, this allows player's and enemies to share those animations. 
            I also looked into converting 3D animations into 2D pixel art animations which allows easy manipulation and creations of 
            characters without having to redraw animations the same way Dead Cells achieve this to automate more of the animation process.
