            <h3>Development - March 2019</h3>
            <p class="description">I first recreated the game snaked by trying to efficiently implement the snake as well as the collisions. 
              This was achieved by having a queue of points to represents the snake and each move would added a head to 
              the front of the snake and remove the end of the tail. When the snake eats food it would just skip one step 
              of removing the tail to increase the length of the snake. Then the collision was only checked against the 
              square the next head was going to be, whether it was out of bounds or part of the snake. Then instead of 
              manually playing the game I wanted to experiment with some algorithm for the snake. For example, a basic but 
              effective algorithm is to just span the rows of the grid leaving one space, essentially moving across every row 
              and then back up to the top. This is a slow algorithm however will always give the best results. Secondly, a 
              made an algorithm that would path find to the food around its tail in the shortest steps. This made the snake 
              very quick to the food and increasing length however could easily lead to trapping itself.</p>
