            <h3>Development - September-Current 2023</h3>
            <p>I set out to learn more about rust but also to refine my game development skills. I can already see the similarities 
              between programming ECS in C++ and Rust Bevy and the conventions are very similar. Understanding how C++ features 
              try and handle memory has made it easy to understand how Rust essentially use these practices by default. For example 
              giving something with memory will automatically move the data as opposed to C++ where you would need std::move().
              </p><p>
                So far I have successfully implemented a chunk loading systems to allow for large tilemap. I then had to readapt, 
                my previous features which consisted of hoeing ground, planting seeds, plants going in stages and then being able 
                to harvest the plant.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Chunk Loading</h3>

          <p>
            Chunk loading is achieved using a custom tilemap separated out into chunks which hold the tiles for that particular chunk. 
            Chunks have a load in distance and load out distance from the player, these values are different to prevent 
            chunks being loaded in an out when moving a little near the loading boarder. Loading consists of creating visual entities for 
            unloaded tiles and saving these entities in a map. The tile data is then synced with the visual entities. 
            The map comes in very useful when unloading as the chunk is used as a key in the map to retrieve all entities in the chunk 
            that can then be despawned.

          <p>
            My goal is to mimic animal movement behaviour, for the sheep movement I pick a random close location within a distance, 
            lets call it a target, then the sheep moves towards this target and then generated another target from that spot. This 
            generally keeps the sheep moving random but around the area it started in. To improve this I would also like to add a 
            state machine to the sheep which allows the sheep to sometimes stop moving as animals do not constantly move. Further, 
            improvement would be to integrate some kind of flocking behaviour that uses data of animals around it to decide it motion.
